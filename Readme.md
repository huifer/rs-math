# Rs-Math

This is a math library, a math library written in Rust.
Write in a native way as much as possible in this math library, reducing the use of third-party libraries.
There may be some errors in this math library, and we hope that users can provide suggestions for modification. I will continue to track related issues when submitting Issues, and if possible, please also participate in my project.
